FIX
collision with the spider_big enemy is a bit weird
 - what happens is that the way that collision is currently programed, if the "Top left corner "of the enemy sprite box is not inside of
 the sprit box of the player or particle, then it wont be registered as a collision. This is probably because the spider_bigs sprite box 
 is so big that it is possible for the other corners {Bottom left, Bottom right, Top right} to enter into the players sprite box
 without the "Top left corner" ever going into the players sprite box.
    ***FIX suggestions***
    1=> make it so that there are several smaller hit boxes inside of the spider_big, this way atleast one hit box will trigger a 
       collision. 
       
       (NOTE on 1=>THIS COULD ALSO BE USED ON LARGE BOSS TYPE MONSTERS TO REGISTER DIFFERENT DAMAGE DONE FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS.)
    
    2=> change collsion detection conditions so that it checks for all four corners of a enemy sprite box. If atleast one corner is
        inside the player sprite box then it would be registered as a hit. 
        
        (NOTE on 2=> :This could introduce an ISSUE. The rear side of the playercould much more easily trigger collision. 
        Like if the player jumps over an enemy while going forward and then goes backward towards the enemy the player would 
        hit the enemy much faster if the bottom righ corner or the top right corner of the enemy is
        accounted for as suggested in this method ) 

Future plans
ADD BOSS ENEMIES
